When the clouds cover up my sunshine I take it as <A HREF= "July_21_Sunshine.html"> inevitable</A>, and maybe that comes off as callous or queer to the straight and narrow-minded.  I took the news of little Charlene's drowning not so much stoically, but removed.  Where was I?  Like the cover:  above.
