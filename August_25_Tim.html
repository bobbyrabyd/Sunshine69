We never really expected to ever be granted status as a church; they might take away the <A HREF= "July_22_Tim.html#2"> ranch</A>, the <A HREF= "July_8_Tim.html#1"> campaign</A>, even the <A HREF= "July_7_Sunshine.html#2"> store;</A> but who would have expected them to hit this family right at the heart of our sacrament:  the acid?  <br><br>I doubt the Christians would have survived it.  <br><br>What's one to make of divine intervention?  Just when it looks like the jig's up--Billy Hitchcock a Fed scapegoat and <I>there goes our bread</I>--this guy <I>just bursts in</I>.  And the tiles get back their shine!  He's got a FUCKING KILO on him, which for some people might be like the first time they hold gold and get a sense of how heavy (despite the usual light-and-fleeting nature) money can be.  Damn! are you saying this heft on my hand is <I>pure</I> (we're not talking pills or paper media here)<I> product!?</I>  We all had a good laugh tossing it back and forth in its bag.  Betcha Nixon never hiked a football <I>half </I>as heavy.<br><br>Restructuring is already at work:  Fat Bobby is taking care of the hash and Randall and Sand are ready for Stark's stash.  It's like <I>The Wizard of Oz</I> when ding-dong the witch is dead!  If I could see in the future I'd wonder what politicians and corporate creeps today will be the turn-ons of tomorrow, giving away money and for once trying to make a positive change for something but the illusory I.  <br><br>All I can say about this new fellow Stark coming on the scene:  it's like the next, lyrical step in <A HREF= "August_29_Sunshine.html"> life-is-but-a-dream</A>.  The cycle is always with us, lest we forget, and with death--either of dreams or the flesh--comes rebirth.  It's in the LSD.  The LSD called me . . . why not others?  I only wish Farmer John could have seen it!   <p><p><p></FONT><Pre></pre><center><A href="August.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0  HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><img border=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><ahref="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a><p><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst. . .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML></HTML>
