The sun going down outside turns all the houses gold as usual and I realize it will look like that for a long time.  When I was a kid I thought I would get gold when I grew up, that's why I saw it everywhere when others didn't.  <br><br>But now I know it's just that it will look like that for a long time.  That's all the gold I get, seeing the sun set behind Berkeley turn the houses all brilliant and festive.  It's free, that half-hour a day.  And so are waterfalls from open hydrants in the summer.  And the dancing of leaf spirits that smell like the past.  Plus little opening crocuses in front of the laundromat.  <A HREF= "August_29_Sunshine.html"> Wonder where Carol is. . . .</A>  <br><br><A HREF= "Ashby_Ave.html#3"> Damn, it's not easy being a grownup.</A> </FONT><Pre></pre><center><A href="August.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0  HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><img border=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><ahref="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a><p><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst. . .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML></HTML>
