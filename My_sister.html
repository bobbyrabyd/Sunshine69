Limbs splayed at irregular angles from black pajamas, singed.  <br><br>"<A NAME="5">My brother</A>," she said.  I understood her.  "Take the gourd and fill it or father will strike me."  I didn't know how to tell her.  It was too late.  "Take it, brother.  Brother who loves me."<br><br>My sister, there is still a chance father will let us leave, live happily alone together beyond the mountain.  The hillside, the jungle is not a place of blood and fire:  it has been a happy place for many thousands of years, and our own souls have loved each other here as birds, as monkeys, and in the cloak of the worms of the earth.
