Every daybeginning on the 21 June solstice, as nights get longer and the agebarrels toward an end, the '69 Calendar will let you pick and probe adifferent date from the Summer of Hate, the Year of the Cock.  It allstarts where it all ended:  mass murders, rock festivals, moon landings,military actions.  <br><br>In 1948, George Orwell wrote <I>1984</I>  to try to foresee how hisfuture would become our present.  <b>SUNSHINE '69</b> is 99's chance tomake sense of what happened halfway.  With <b>SUNSHINE '69</b>, historytakes a wicked twist on the 'Net:  daily updates, graphics, audio,animation, and the chance to change the past . . . sign the guestbook andleave your footprints in the '69 log. <I> It's an a/v and textadventure!</I><BR><br>Navigate Sixties-space on the '69 Monstamap.  Search through the '69Suitcase.  Tune-in to some RealAudio on the '69 8-track.  You're safe todrive to 'Nam and back in the <b>SUNSHINE '69</b> Rambler.  Just fastenyour seat belt and make sure to lock the door.  You never know when someTac Squad goon or tripping, hippie freak will try to hijack your bucketto Haight Ashbury or the Oakland Induction Center for more mayhem thanyou've got gas for.<br><br>You can keep coming back for more all summer long, because <b>SUNSHINE '69</b> gets bigger and weirder as time runs out.  Plus there promises to be a good dose of conspiracy, a host of hallucinations, a little bit of sex, and one helluva bang before the sun burns out at the catastrophic climax.  <br></font><Pre></pre><center><A href="June.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0  HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><img border=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><a href="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a><br><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst. . .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><P><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML>
