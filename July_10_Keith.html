Who wants to give a kid a chance to take a gun forthe first time and get shot by someone who is a professional all along? Some of the people coming backstage to try to convince Mick and me tofire the first shot I thought were plants from your CIA and FBI, if notthere to entrap us then to use us to get the cats to stick their necksout.  It's a lose/lose situation, with all of us scrawny and scraggy andthe man's knives were sharp and I mean <I>sharp</I>.  <br> <br> Maybethey're ready in <A HREF= "Dear.html"> New York</A> or <A HREF="July_17_Keith.html"> LA</A>.
