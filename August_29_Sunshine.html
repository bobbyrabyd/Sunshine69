You'd never guess, with the dirty looks you get on long waits for cable cars, <A HREF= "69_Map.html#1"> this city</A> can be so small, sly, serendipitous.  I told him I'd walk from Golden Gate Park to the Greyhound.  He insisted on dropping me off.  I said I'd walk--wanted to get in another service giving out Sunshine on the Haight before getting on the bus.  He said <I>sure?</I>  I kind of wonder if I should have said yes.<br><br>The sedan pulls up like only a sedan can:  a SHARK.  <A HREF= "July_28_Sunshine.html#2"> I'd say I was seeing things</A> if it weren't for the jaws.  A man with gangster gloves like in the movies.  I think things like this happen all the time on the Haight, because if anyone else sees it it didn't arouse much alarm.  I just take it in stride--the next step in a ride that began weirder than even THE MAN can make it.  Checkered suit, soft brown hat.  That's the freak who, in the back seat, decorously suggests I put on the mask, a Lone Ranger affair with elastic strap, only no eyeholes.   Is his accent British?  Indian?  British-Indian?  Blue Meany?  The smile all the same right out of <I>Yellow Submarine</I>, teeth gleaming to contain a bird just gnashed or a meatball so sour it would explode in a blaze of burning red sauce if exposed to even the littlest beam of sunshine.<br><br><A HREF= "August_30_Sunshine___Ali.html"> He compliments me on my lovely hair.
