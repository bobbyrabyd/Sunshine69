I'll be so high because it won't be like I'm a <A HREF= "November_20_Murdock.html"> whore</A>, I'm making love.  That's what playing free feels like, giving it away.  And <I>wanting </I> it!<br><br>The Maysles getting it on, the brilliant lights Chip pulls out of his arse in an hour, the stage and the massive fucking droves.  Red satin:  a lilting, diminutive touch in a pinch (make that a crush) like this.  I'm like Shelley, leaving lyrics for the listless, leaving them listless, but letting them fly for an hour or two.  I'm easy enough to break, but don't think I don't bely a little radiant fabric.  I'll rend that cape in the ecstasy of Midnight Rambler (it hurts!) and tear it up like Jimi's Monterey or Townsend's Woodstock.  Fuck 'em all.  I mean God love 'em.
