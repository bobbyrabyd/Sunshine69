Hoo, hoooo."  Walk like a cock.  Pocket full of rock.  Rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' fucking roll, rock 'n' fucking sucking roll:  these are the three species of inebriant contained in pop.  My <A HREF= "November_5_Ali.html"> antidote</A> has all of those, including a whole hell full of harassment and interdiction,  search and destroy. <br><br>Almost want to take a vial and pour it in a bin of refuse, over one of those discarded weiner buns, sit back and watch the fireworks while a whole bevy of birds go haywire.  Problem is with all the deadbeats burrowing around it would most likely get soaked up by a trash-picking bum.  "Drifter turns Maniac!  Unknown Drug?  Another Murder Cult?"  The last thing I need before the <A HREF= "November_6_Murdock.html"> big day</A> is headlines of <A HREF= "August_5_Ali.html"> the troubled stuff</A> and an unknowing narc picking up my trail.  What am I going to tell him:  "But I'm on your side, this stuff's going to REALLY open people's eyes. . . ."  Who can count how many times the cops have heard that?  <br><br>Ignoramuses like <A HREF= "Timothy_Leary.html"> Leary</A> have already tried that jive.  It's getting to be that better living through chemistry has become a black sheep crying wolf:  don't just ignore it, shoot whenever you hear it bleat.  Outrageous as it is I've gotten this far with the <A HREF= "Orange_Sunshine.html"> Brotherhood</A>, I'm beginning to take for granted that holding out this last month will be a piece of cake.  It's like they're assuring their own demise.  Almost as if they know they're destined to die.  Have to admit, <A HREF= "September_6_Stark.html"> I pity them a little</A>.  Every day is like a blessing waking up and remembering the enemy, even if they did find me out, wouldn't hurt a fly.  But it's better not to get too sloppy.  Just because there's no danger in this mission doesn't mean the stakes aren't high.  <br><br>There's a <A HREF= "November_4_Norm.html"> protest in the park</A> and I make out an old contact from <A HREF= "Sunshine__stolen.html"> the company</A> milling about at the periphery in a poor approximation of hippie.  Used to know the fellow well.  Wish I could go over and say hello, but doing so could blow my cover and his.  Even though most folks are so stoned and sunstruck they don't even think to suspect a fox in the chicken coop.  And then a hipster parked in a convertible taps the brim of his hat.  Who's that?  "Sympathy for the Devil" blares shrilly from his radio.  A friend?  <A HREF= "August_16_Ali.html"> Paranoia takes no holiday</A>, always ready to burst my bubble.  Is it the asshole who <A HREF= "August_14_Ali.html"> blew my cover at the last rock restive-all</A>?  Better keep on trucking, walking the thin line between hippie and heavy.  <br><br>Generational salvation:  a lonely business.  Hope you don't guess my name.<p><p><p></FONT><center><A href="November.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><img border=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><a href="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a> <p><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst. . .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><P><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML>
