There's nowhere we're really going, except into hard jobs for long times and out the other end into old age.  But we get our kicks while we can.  <A HREF= "Rebound.html"> Loving the ladies.</A>  <A HREF= "Murdock__09_00.html"> Shooting hoops.</A>  <A HREF= "Unh_hun.html"> Shooting the shit.</A>  <br><br>Chain link is a way of life.  As is asphalt.  Twining fingers around chain link to hop a fence unleashes an energy and a terrible taste that makes me feel like a kid again.  I'm not a kid any more.  The kids in my neighborhood call me Murdock.  Just like everybody else except my mother.  But in the kids' mouths it sounds like awe and a taste of what they want to be.  A Murdock.  I'm not a kid any more and it's time to live up to that, to what's possible, what makes a child grow inside to match his height on the outside.  <br></font><p><p><p><Pre></pre><center><A href="June.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC ="images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0  HSPACE="9" SRC ="images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><img border=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"><a href="69_Map.html"><img border=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/map.gif"></a><p><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst. . .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><P><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML>
