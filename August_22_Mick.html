The property master profuse in her apologies.  Scared out of her wits, poor girl, more by me and what I might do than what had happened--scareder than me.  Wearing that ridiculous stovepipe helmet for a costume, the world seemed narrower than ever through the aperture.  <br><br>My hand is bruised and bandaged.  My Marianne lies  in convalescence in Germany, barely out of a coma and I know in a way she will never be back.  There aren't enough brain cells in the day to withstand the sort of punishment she wreaks.  Or is the right word reaps?  <br><br>Something the old man has got to understand is that the Rolling Stones are not for rent, for nobody.  Helping his public image along never entailed letting our show be a charade for his own onstage antics, an attempt to run for election, whatever.  And we don't do command performances, not even for royalty.  <I>Look, S'tan, we dedicated that record to you . . . play that anthem-apology at every show. . . .
