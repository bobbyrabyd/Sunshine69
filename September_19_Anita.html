But I'm neither stretched out nor worn out, baby!  It's the dipstick who denies herself her own transcendence just because of the caprices of a timid or otherwise-occupied partner.  "Stop the ride I wanna get off!" is just the breadth of a demon's bristle away from "Sweet Satan I think I've grasped the eternal in your thickly-settled grip!"  <br><br>I'll be Jimi's girl at the drop of a black feathered hat, and just as jocularly take a spin with Spanish Tony, Hampton Mick, or half the hombres of a colorful Kingston village.  Not even the ol' man's wicked imagination is a match for my wiles.  Try an' break me:  I'll bend over backwards and you'll end up with your head up your ass, if that's the kind of thing you're into!<br></FONT><br> <Pre></pre><center><A href="September.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0  HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><img border=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><a href="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a><p><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst. . .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><P><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML>
