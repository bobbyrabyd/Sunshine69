She has a sumptuous innocence like so many California girls--the ones I down by the bucket on the <A HREF= "Haight.html"> Haight</A>, compulsively like popcorn--but attendant is a feature that makes her a rarer morsel, more tempting than a seven-course meal though all-told less than a mouthful:  the arrogance of one uncompromised and not for sale, at least not today . . .<A HREF= "October_23_Sunshine.html">  "in whom brazenness is a kind of grace."</A>  <br><br>She is the fat olive at the end of a whole tumbler of Martinis, the first bite of mahi-mahi on the tip of the fork, the bar of freeze-dried ice cream that's been in space and made it back.  And lo! though I dilate the nether aperture of my digestive tract to a greater breadth than the area's great bay, still I cannot <A HREF= "September_8_Lucifer.html"> swallow her whole</A>.<br><br>And so I go home 317 arrestees richer but with a new hunger in my belly, sour and squealing all through my meal of 278 fresh casualties from across the seas, a need that will not easily be quelled, and yet that somehow relieves; for by its prominence this new ache relieves a thousand other petty irritations.  For all the lost souls, wandering waifs, and runaways available to me this moment on Telegraph, at Mission, in Sausalito, etc., there is <A HREF= "September_15_Lucifer.html"> one I cannot possess</A> this night in the hideous haven around Berkeley High.  <br><br>Patience:  my most invigorating and abhorred stimulus.  This piece will take chewing, much chewing, much more chewing than I believe myself capable of doing.<br></FONT><br><br><Pre></pre><center><A href="October.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC ="images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><imgborder=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><ahref="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a><p><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst.. .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML>
