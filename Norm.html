I fought the war.  I went to war.  I came back to fight the war.<br><br>It's as crazy to be back-as blind, senseless nuts-as it was to be there in the surrealistic rock embodying all that death and gore songs and seances are elegantly composed for back home, on the same thin surface of earth thousands of miles behind but on the SAME GODDAMN THIN FUCKING SURFACE OF EARTH a decision made in oval office shit rooms with cigar smoke and bourbon sent a thousand more of my brothers to die in my sight my eyes fill with blood.  <br><br>My eyes fill with blood at the thought.  <br><br>Back here I think I know what you mean.  There will never be any going back to not knowing what it was really like, just dreading and imagining.  Now there's knowing (although the memory at times seems false, dreamlike, like I might have imagined it) and following a laughing insanity to protests and sing-ins with all the lovely freaky hippie kids who I want to embrace to death their not knowing an ounce of it.  Still dying. <br></FONT><Pre></pre><center><A href="June.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC ="images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><imgborder=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><ahref="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a><br><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst. . .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><P><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML>
