But this is a girl one look will tell you she is just here for the books.  Glasses little and grannyish but she knows how to hide behind them. <br><br>I'm really not that interested when I go up and lean on the shelf, tell her she should read the lesser known stuff, which isn't even in most bookstores as far as I know.  I just picture a shy, pretty protest girl getting wowed by <I>The Lime Twig</I>  and not even knowing about <I>Second Skin</I>, just the sort of story that might, like a warm sun, make her bloom into a woman.  I've broken an introverted rapture and she mutters something half to herself about just having finished this one, doesn't understand why they don't have any others.  Suspicious of the <A HREF= "November_10_Norm.html"> familiar stranger</A>, trying to get away and put the book back on the shelf at the same time, curious about the title named, wishing he hadn't happened, and then all of a sudden I produce the volume, emblazoned with the familiar name of the adored author, which in superstition she must have seen as a <A HREF= "Skin.html"> sign of kinship</A>.  <br></FONT><p><p><p><center><A href="November.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><img border=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><a href="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a> <p><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst. . .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><P><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML>
