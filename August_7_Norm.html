Somewhere back there (out beyond the back seat of Granddaddy's Studebaker, through the back windshield, past the back yard, over the back fence, in a back lot with a brick wall and a barrel, a pyramid of tin cans) I learned how to line up the perforation in my iris with the crosshair on the muzzle so the target cannot break my distant grip.  I learned how to squeeze, not pull the trigger so my own movement can barely affect the tenuous air.  I learned the hand-eye-mind talent of following flight of bird, man, or a flailing tin can moments earlier released from Granddaddy's frail hand.
