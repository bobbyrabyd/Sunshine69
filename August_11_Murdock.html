Like, <A HREF= "Lover__not_a_fighter.html#1"> the day I learn I wouldn't serve</A> she tells me <I>I don't</I> <I>think it's worth it any more--I mean</I>. . . .  She didn't have to say what she means.  It already said itself.  My <A HREF= "Green_suit.html#1"> cool green suit</A> now imbued with a tall story of punishment and pain; it got so I wished I had <A HREF= "Combat_patrol.html#1"> taken the gun</A> in my hand:  just as a job, to be a man. <br><br>Momma, you tear me apart, I see your face only now, now that the ether has ebbed and I'm no longer brain-dead, not necessarily pain-dead but not feeling the edge of joy or dismay . . . just dull:  dim, damned, dull.  <I>Why'd I come out black, Momma?</I>  After all, I could have made it worse by saying something like that.  Why, even though you and Daddy were taught never to cry, did I have to look so midnight black when Carol's only going to settle down with someone smoothe and yellow as her?<br><br><A HREF= "August_4_Murdock.html"> The cone was brown, the ice cream black.</A>  But the drips ran white as fright down my huge hand.  When I saw the cone was broken it wasn't on purpose.  Just another freak accident that happens when tendons take on ideas of their own.  When the astronauts came back to earth, I started coming back to normal. Today they let them out of the isolation chamber (talk about moongerms and spacedust) and I feel pretty much better, but none-the-less disoriented for having been in orbit and back, blinking, a bitch of a brain boiling on my shoulders.<p><p><p></FONT><Pre></pre><center><A href="August.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0  HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><img border=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><ahref="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a><p><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst. . .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML></HTML>
