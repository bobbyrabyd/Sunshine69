Now <I>that's </I>a hummer!  "Bad trips" are just as eye-opening, only they require (and, when unexpected, tend to engender) a chrome constitution.

But they don't know the abandon by which these youngsters have blindly devoured the idea of this sinister substance acid.  And I don't even expect to have to call it acid before the foolhardy, voracious hamsters go gobbling it up.  <br></FONT><br><br><br><A NAME="6"></A><Pre></pre><center><A href="August.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0  HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><img border=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><ahref="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a><p><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst. . .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML></HTML>
