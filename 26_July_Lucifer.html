As much as itprovoked reverential pleasure each time I beheld the orderliness by whichewe ess guv was capable of processing <A HREF= "Dad.html"> its ownsons</A> for slaughter, when one got away who by all accounts was in needof snuffing out--like <A HREF= "Ashby_Ave.html"> that spastic,conscientious brother from South Berkeley</A>--my heart of cooled magmadropped.  No hundreds of thousands of exceptional specimens, offered upon <A HREF= "July_19_Lucifer.html"> the draft altar</A> to the gnashingjaws of war, could lift it in its igneous heaviness . . . all because ofthe infinitesimal exceptionalness of <I>one who got away</I>.<br> <br>He might have gone the way of the geese at winter's end; gone off togookville, like <A HREF= "Lamb.html#1"> a good ram</A>, for his feedbagof shrapnel; or even gotten political (ewe!) and <A HREF= "Sendoff.html">burned his ticket</A>--getting, for his fifteen seconds of street theater,an express transfer to Port Penitentiary, where draft-dodge martyrsembark on a restful, three-year tour.  Whatever route he would havetaken, he would have been out of the way!  As it turned out, in spite ofmy considerable connections in the upper echelons of random drawings andluckless lotteries, <A HREF= "Lover__not_a_fighter.html"> his numberdidn't come up</A>. </FONT><Pre></pre><center><A href="July.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0  HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><img border=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><a href="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a><p><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst. . .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><P><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML>
