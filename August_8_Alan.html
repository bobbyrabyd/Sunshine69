Angels all dance by firelight--no! Angels <I>are</I> firelight, breaking the black air with whoops and leaps like awgawd! I didn't think I had this much party in me when a little red gets into my belly that's when I go! go! go!<br><br>Most everyone on this run's got a mama but instead of them heading into the woods to get off it's like the first time I got on the road with the guys when I was a prospect.  Mesmerized by the flames, drunk on Bud and the perfume of pine and fire, we stomp and holler like the devil himself, the old ladies sitting by and grunting not-all comfortably that boys will be boys.  They don't get it.  A woman never gets the devil in her.<br><br>The wind we make whips licks of fire up and the great redwoods quake.  Branches tremble.  Needles quiver to the ground.  <A HREF= "August_9_Alan.html#2"> Earth shudders</A>.  <p><p><p></FONT><Pre></pre><center><A href="August.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0  HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><img border=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><ahref="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a><p><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst. . .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML></HTML>
