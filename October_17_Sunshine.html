But it's when I look up to the sky, to conjure a little more self-pity by seeing the desert sun up there all awful and irksome, that I have that peculiar  sensation, right out of the horror movie routine:  I'm being watched.  Hello.<br><br>"Excellent," Ali says.  "You have indeed been called, Sunshine.  Now find the cutting stone."<br><br>"I brought my jackknife."  He frowns in a way that has become too familiar:  <A HREF= "September_13_Sunshine.html"> when I go on about LSD</A>, <A HREF= "October_16_Sunshine.html"> want to whine a little about how new and scarey it seems</A>, <A HREF= "October_10_Sunshine.html"> call the sacred cactus peyote</A>.  "Okay . . . what is it this time, Ali?"<br><br>"This is not a what-is-it-this-time, Sunshine.  This is life and death."  Ali spins in place and raises his arms, giving a big apology to all the desert for my indiscretion, making me shrink right there in my spot 'til I'm as tall as the jikuli that found me.  <br><br>"It is imperative not to introduce foreign elements to this desert like your metallic blade; to do so would be to upset the earth's immune system--and invoke great disfavor."  A little petulant, I, at this point, wondering whether Ali intends to introduce a new clause ever time it looks like I'm about to taste the fruit of psychedelia.  It's been six weeks since <A HREF= "August_29_Sunshine.html"> my last acid trip</A>!  I ask him to tell me about THE cutting stone.  Is there more than one out there?  "Many millions, indeed, but only one that will find you first."  <br><br>I find one right away the size of a tomahawk head.  A little thicker than might be used for chopping a tree, but it does taper nicely at one edge in a knife-like way.  "How's this, Ali?"  I hold it up hopefully.<br><br>He approaches me expressionlessly and takes the stone in his hand, then looks up at me as if I were crazy.  "Would a surgeon use this to operate on a patient?"  I know my Cheshire grin well enough, but I can't seem to wipe it off my face even when I'm aware it's there.  "How would the earth like you trying to rip it open with this blunt hunk of rock?"<br><br>"I'm sorry Ali.  I'm tired.  You never said HOW sharp."<br><br>"Let it be sharp enough so that you would use it to draw your own blood."  GULP.  That gets me thinking.  And I bet it's on purpose that he leaves me wondering whether I will have to use it to do just that.  There's one thing I can say about his need-to-know mode of operating:  certainly has kept me on my toes.  "The cactus makes an imprint when it beholds your face the first time, this is acceptance, of a sort, although it doesn't end there:  you have to ask to <A HREF= "October_18_Sunshine.html"> receive its meaning</A>, apologize for severing its life, water it wishing it well."  <br></FONT><Pre></pre><center><A href="October.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC ="images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><imgborder=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><ahref="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a><p><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst.. .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML>
