How couldn't it have been deliberate?  Such an easyhit. . . .  When he sank like a sack of potatoes at my elbow I knew thisman's corpse was no place for a capricious, pacifist sharpshooter.  How Iever <A HREF= "August_7_Norm.html#3"> suspected otherwise</A> I don'tknow if I'll ever know.  <br><br>Deliberate, but not intentional.  <A HREF= "The_caged_bird.html"> I'm powerless.</A>  Haven't slept in two days.  <br><br>Police are trained to hold fire until threat is beyond a doubt.  How is it that Marines have to adopt exactly the opposite attitude?
