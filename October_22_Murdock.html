Regie says if I don't want Gwen and Momma to be bothered any more he can get me one of those little nickel-plated specials some of the Panther boys have been carrying around.  If I get up the guts to see her again I'm going to go in and ask that man (where he slickly pressed his card is still clutched like a sore spot in my hand) what <I>he </I>knows.  I have a right.  <A HREF= "Unh_hun.html"> I was once her man</A>.  But it won't be too soon:  there's still a little forgetting to do, and the best way is by learning something new. <br><br>The city's pretty, but I like what's happening in Berkeley.  There's a girl named <A HREF= "October_30_Murdock.html"> Patty</A> who's fine as sunshine and I think she'll go out with me next week if I ask her:  she complimented my Mustang and she <A HREF= "The_Line.html"> liked the line</A>.  <br><br>The Bay Bridge is umbrella'd by a milky haze some six hundred feet above.  But that doesn't make a difference on the lower deck.  San Francisco shrugs away behind your shoulder with a definite grievance in mind, but it'll forget by the time you get back.  Oakland's always a little hairy on my eye.  So's <A HREF= "Altamont.html"> Livermore</A>, 'cause I once knew a girl there.  She left too soon.  Others not soon enough.<br><br>The crest of 580 gives way to a sinister snake slithering away into the invisible distance.  And I'm out on the highway, the humped hills and windmills sweeping my mind clean.<br></FONT><Pre></pre><center><A href="October.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC ="images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><imgborder=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><ahref="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a><p><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst.. .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML>
