Meredith Hunter is mine, an offering, although his soul resides elsewhere.  In the case of The State of California versus Alan Passaro, well, the imposition of a gun image on peoples' consciousness and recollection had a certain sedative effect on all the participants, prosecution and defense, who recognizing in the powerful aura around the defendant the case as already dead, merely chose to proceed with formalities in order to appease a troublesome conscience on the part of the broader public and testified as to the presence of the disappearing pistol.<br><br><A HREF= "Distillation.html"> I planted seeds in everyone's heads</A>.

While actually it was "Under my Thumb."    <p><p><p></FONT><Pre></pre><center><A href="June.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0  HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><img border=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><ahref="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a><p><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst. . .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML>
