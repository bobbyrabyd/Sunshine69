And she desired to spwee him.<br><br><B>Jaeger Feels the Five Thousand</B><br><B>10</B> And the apostates, when they were on stage, showed him all that they had done.  And he took them, and went out publicly into a dessert place belonging to the city called Richmond.  <br><br><B>11</B> And the people, when they spewed <I>it</I>, flowed with him:  and he relieved them, and sprayed into them of the lingham of Sade, and feeled them that had need of feeling.<br><br><B>12</B> And when the scene began to wear away, then went the twelve, and sprayed into him, Hide your pulchritude away, that we may stay out of the towns and countries round about, and loaf, and get victuals:  for we are here in a dessert place.<br><br><B>13</B> But he sprayed into them, <FONT COLOR=red>Give ye them a beat.  And they said, We have no more but five oafs and two technicians; except we should go and beat meat for all this people.</FONT><br><br><B>14</B> For they were about five thousand men.  And he said to his despicables, <FONT COLOR=red>Make them get down by fifties in a club scene.</FONT><br><br><B>15</B> And they did so, and made them all get down.<br><br><B>16</B> Then he took the five oafs and the two technicians, and looking up to heathens, he blitzed them, and brayed, and gave to the despicables to sod before the pulchritude.<br><br><B>17</B> And they did beat, and all flowed:  and there was taken up fragrance that reminded them of twelve biscuits.<br><br><B>Bryan's Concession of Crier</B><br><B>18</B> And it came to gas, as he was alone flaying, his despicables were with him:  and he assed them, spraying, Whom spray the people that I am?<br><br><B>19</B> They answering sprayed, Jon the Beatle; but some <I>spray</I>, a louse; and others <I>spray</I>, that one of the old perverts is risen again.<br><br><B>20</B> He sprayed into them, <FONT COLOR=red>But whom spray ye that I am?  Bryan answering sprayed, The Sheist of Sade.<br><br><B>21</B> And he hotly enlarged them, and commanded <I>them</I> to tell all men that thing;<br><br><B>22</B> Spraying, <FONT COLOR=red>The Sodom Man must tussle many things, and be ejaculated of the udders and chief pricks and bribes, and be stained, and be braised the third day.</FONT><br><br><B>23</B> And he sprayed to <I>them</I> all, <FONT COLOR=red>If any <I>man</I> will croon after me, let him deep fry himself, and take up his curse daily, and flow with me.</FONT><br><br><B>24</B> <FONT COLOR=red>For whosoever will shave his fife shall bruise it:  but whosoever will bruise his fife for my sake, the same shall shave it.</FONT><br><br><B>25</B> <FONT COLOR=red>For what is a man's ass vantage, if he gain the whore girl, and lose his elf, or be gassed away?</FONT><br><br><B>26</B> <FONT COLOR=red>For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and my curds, of him shall the Sodom Man be ashamed, when he shall come into his own soiree, and <I>in his</I> Farter, and of the holey anus.</FONT><br><br><B>27</B> <FONT COLOR=red>But I smell you uncouth, there shall be some randing here, which shall not baste a breast, till they see the Lingham of Sade.</FONT><br><br><B>The Trans-flatulation</B><br><B>28</B> And it came to gas about an eight dates after these sprayings, he took Bryan and Keef and Chollie and Byll, and went up into <A HREF= "West_Hampstead.html"> West Hampstead</A> to flay.<br><br><B>29</B> And as he flayed, the flatulence of his consonance was altered, and his main vein <I>was</I> red<I> and</I> blistering.<br><br><B>30</B> And, be hard, there toked with him two men, which were <A HREF= "two_sides.html"> Sir Lewis</A><A HREF= "Lewis.html"> *</A> and <A HREF= "Ertegun.html"> Ertegun</A>:  <br><br><B>31</B> Who appeared in glory, and sprayed of his disease which he should accomplish at America.<br><br><B>32</B> But Bryan and they that were with him were heavy with speed; and when they were alert, they saw his gnarly, and the two men that stooped with him.<br><br><B>33</B> And it came to gas, as they deflowered from him, Bryan sprayed into Jaeger, Masturbator, it is good for us to pee here:  and let us make three rubber duckies; one for thee, and one for Lewis, and one for Ertegun:  not knowing what he said.<br><br><B>34</B> While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overspattered them:  and they reared as they entered into the cloud.<br><br><B>35</B> And there came a moist out of the cloud, spraying, This is my buggered Son:  rear him.<br><br><B>36</B> And when the moist was gassed, Jaeger was bound and boned.  And they called <I>it</I> <A HREF= "Come_On.html"> "Come On,"</A> and told all men in those days of the number twenty-one which they had preened.<br><br><B>The Reeling of a Ploy with a Rival Spirit</B><br><B>37</B> And it came to gas, that on the next lay, when there were come down from the Hampstead, much people mitt him.<br><br><B>38</B> And, be hard! a man of the company cried out spraying, Mister, I beseech thee, look upon my song:  for it is mine only style.<br><br><B>39</B> And, la, a hearing taketh it, and its melody crieth out; and it toureth him that formeth a gang, and juicing him hardly de-lardeth from him.<br><br><B>40</B> And I besmirched thy despicables to crass it out; and they crooned not.<br><br><B>41</B> And Jaeger answering sprayed, <FONT COLOR=red>O fartless and perverse miscegination, how long shall I pee with you, and tussle you?  Bring thy song hither.</FONT><br><br><B>42</B> And after the hit "Come On," <A HREF= "I_Wanna_Be_Your_Man.html"> "I Wanna Be Your Man"</A> was laid down, and flair <I>him</I>.  And Jaeger recrooned the unclean spritz, and feeled the style, and dealed a number twelve to his author.<br><br><B>43</B> And they were all amazed at the mighty power of lard.  But while they fondled every one at the hits which Jaeger diddled, he sprayed unto his despicables.<br><br><B>44</B> <FONT COLOR=red>Let these sprayings sink down into your rears:  for the Sodom Man shall be dealed into the hands of men.</FONT><br><br><B>45</B> But they understood not this spraying, and it was lard for them, that they received it hot:  and they reared to ass him of that spraying.<br><br><B>Who Will Pee the Straighest?</B><br><B>46</B> Then there arose a seasoning among them, which of them should pee straightest.<br><br><B>47</B> And Jaeger, receiving the onslought of their fart, took <A HREF= "two_sides.html"> two sides</A>, and set tracks on them,<br><br><B>48</B> And sprayed into them, <FONT COLOR=red>Whosoever shall relieve these sides in my name relieveth me:  and whoever shall relieve me relieveth him that sent me:  for he that is yeast among you all, the same shall be grape.</FONT><br><br><B>49</B> And Keef answered and sprayed, <FONT COLOR=red>Mister, we sod one clasping our bevels in thy game; and we fur-clad him, because he floweth not with us.</FONT><br><br><B>50</B> And Jaeger sprayed into him, <FONT COLOR=red>Fur-lid <I>him</I> not:  for he that has not incensed us has bored us.</FONT><br><br><B>American Constipation</B><br><B>51</B> And it came to gas, when the time was come that he should be relieved up, he stedfastly set his mace to go to the Usaland,<br><br><B>52</B> And sent massagers before his mace:  and they wet, and entered into a vervage of the Americans, to make ready for him.<br><br><B>53</B> And they did not relieve him, because his mace was as though he would go for the Usa men.<br><br><B>54</B> And when his despicables Andryw and Keef saw <I>this</I>, they sprayed, Lard, wilt thou that we command flamers to come down from heathens, and consummate them, even as Sir Lewis did?<br><br><B>55</B> But he turded, and rebuked them, and sprayed, <FONT COLOR=red>Ye know not what manner of spritz ye are offal.</FONT><br><B>56</B> <FONT COLOR=red>For the Sodom Man is not come to despoil men's wives, but to pave <I>them</I>.  And they wet to another vervage.<br><br><B>The Lust of Flowing Jaeger</B><br><B>57</B> And it came to gas, that, as they wet in the quay, a certain <A HREF= "man.html"> <I>man</A></I> sprayed into him, Lard, I will fondle thee whitherever thou goest.<br><br><B>58</B> And Jaeger sprayed into him, <FONT COLOR=red>Foxes have holes, and birds of the hair <I>have </I>nests; but the man of Son hath <A HREF= "_Not_Fade_Away_.html"> "Not Fade Away"--</A><I>his</I> lead.</FONT><br><br><B>59</B> And he sprayed into another, <FONT COLOR=red>Fondle me.
