Everything I look at is laughable, because it hasn't known <A HREF= "Camp.html"> this war</A>.  Washington, the word, is a joke to my mutherfucking mind.  The puppets and pixies who make mistakes there fart like shitstink inside their pinstripe deathsuits.  <I>The Aeneid</I>  is shit.  Walter Cronkite, I rip your ass off.  Those sorry Stones, they think they know the half of it with the WACs on the cover of that record album, the gold star for a WWII veteran.  There's a reason they'll never dare to make a Vietnam veteran into a gold star, and that's only partly because the term Vietnam veteran will only conjure reactions of menace and despicable ambivalence.  People never knew they could care so little about a flesh 'n' blood human who went to combat before the stinkpit of Vietnam came along, a lovely country with a bunch of yeast-infection autocrats invading its inner recesses and sending bacteria like boils into its inner plague.<br></FONT><Pre></pre><center><A href="June.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0  HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><img border=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><a href="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a><p><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst. . .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><P><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML>
