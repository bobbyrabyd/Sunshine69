"There's been somebody here to see you.  A white man . . . maybe a cop?"  I want to know how she knows, but that would give away I'm worried.<br><br>"Ain't nothing, Momma.  Some honky from the government asking what kind of <A HREF= "August_20_Murdock.html"> postman</A> I'll make.  I'm going to start bringing home money, I mean it, and soon!"<br><br>She's silent in that way I know she knows I'm lying.  But she also knows I can handle it.  And I'll probably do better not to get her into it.  This makes her sad.<br><br>Seems I go from one interrogation to another these days.  The Man keeps showing up, then Momma gets in on the act.  It must have been the stinky cigars that gave him away.<br><br>I would never hurt Carol.  But now that it's been almost a month they can't find her I'm starting to worry if <A HREF= "September_26_Sunshine.html"> she's going to be okay</A>, after all.  I'd never hurt Carol, but a half-assed flatfoot's got me lying to my mother.
