Even though it might look like her and I didn't let her see me and people might think I'm nuts.  Sure, the <A HREF= "October_14_Murdock.html"> P. I.</A> is satisfied.  So are <A HREF= "September_10_Murdock.html"> her folks</A>, I guess, who probably haven't even been to Laguna Beach in person, but have seen the P. I.'s blurry pictures and that lets them believe they still have some control over her.  But for me the decoy is a chilling augury.  <A HREF= "October_31_Lucifer.html"> Who the hell</A> did that girl get mixed up with to make a <A HREF= "November_1_Sunshine.html"> monster like this</A>?<br><br>Regie delivered the thing <A HREF= "October_22_Murdock.html"> just like he promised</A>.

It's the bad, wet red the serpent picked from the tree.<br><br>It's enough to make me grab a little the thing that weighs at my side.  Just for the grounding in something hard, heavy when the rest of the world lurches by <A HREF= "November_24_Murdock.html"> so unbalanced, even immaterial</A>.  <br></FONT><br><br><center><A href="November.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><img border=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><a href="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a> <p><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst. . .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><P><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML>
