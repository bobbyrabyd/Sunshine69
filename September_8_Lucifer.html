The demise is the meal, the conditions (common cold or Cold War) just decor.  <br><br>Communism as evil?  Absolutely!  Especially insofar as we anticipate it'll actually get anywhere (except escalated mayhem) to try eradicating the outrageous attitudes of misanthropy and indifference to difference perpetrated on a people (purportedly democratic and devoted to free lives vs. demagogic and indentured to free enterprise) by an invidious and inhumane consumption-centric technocracy.  At least that's how <A HREF= "September_27_Lucifer.html"> my analyst</A> sees it.  If religion is the opiate of the people, irreligion is the crystal meth.  All cranked up and no peace to go is a good motto for the militant Marxist.  <br><br>We're all just part of the cycle . . . so love, fuck, and FIGHT THE MAN--cuz the next generation'll recycle.  At least start a riot at a show.  It's all about eating.  <A HREF= "September_15_Lucifer.html"> And a little slap and tickle.</A>  <p><p><p></FONT><Pre></pre><center><A href="September.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0  HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><img border=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><a href="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a><p><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst. . .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><P><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML>
