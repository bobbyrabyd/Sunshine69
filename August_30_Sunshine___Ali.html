I knew my father would send someone after me eventually.  I didn't expect it to be so cloak-and-dagger, but my <A HREF= "July_7_Sunshine.html"> new life</A> must have horrified his spies.  After the mask there was a pill to "help me relax," and I don't know how long I slept but here it's cool and there's a lilting whine, but maybe that's just in my dizzy head.

There's a mission of more importance than anyone from the Brotherhood can afford to be away--it would call too much attention to the church.
